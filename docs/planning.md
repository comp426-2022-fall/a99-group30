# Planning
We first brain stormed ideas utilizing which public apis we could use. We all agreed on using TheMealDB which is a free meal api. From there we assigned roles based on everyone's specialty utilizing each others' background. We communicated consistently through zoom and groupme to keep track of each of our progress. As we built the database first, we then added the back-end component to it. From there, we added the necessary functionality for the app and to communicate properly with the API. We finalized our changes by Dec. 8th.
